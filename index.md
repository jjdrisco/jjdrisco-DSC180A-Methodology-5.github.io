**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we've covered so far is linkage disequilibrium and founder populations and how they impact our ability to perform GWAS.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue is using eQTL's to investigate disease expression across multiple generations if we can find age qualifiers for the genomes we have access to.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I have had to change the way I'm approaching running linear regression models  by limiting input sizes because of their computational impact.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in overlaying locuszooms to show similarities in similar coding sections of genes.
